<h2>1. Installation</h2>
<p>To install simply extract and upload the contents of this archive
to your web server and make your way to the installer.php and follow the
on screen guide.<br />
We recommend installing WhiteCrane to the base directory of your domain
for best compatibility.</p>
<p>If the installation should fail see the FAQ below or send mail to
thetooth@ameoto.com</p>
<h2>2. FAQ</h2>
<ul>
	<li>
	<p><strong>After i install WhiteCrane i can't seem to
	login</strong><br />
	If your looking for the login box just press the + on the bottom right
	of the page. If you still can't login you can try <br />
	reinstalling by deleting the config.php file and running the installer
	script again.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>Oh noes! i turned off &quot;display login on
	every page&quot; and can't login!</strong><br />
	To login in you can send your details via the URL <br />
	e.g.&nbsp;<a
		href="http://example.com/path-to-wc/index.php?act=log&amp;username=yournamehere&amp;password=yourpassword">http://example.com/path-to-wc/index.php?act=log&amp;username=yournamehere&amp;password=yourpassword</a></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>When installing it asks to send information to
	Ameoto Systems</strong><br />
	The installation script sends minimal information about your server and
	an address to access it from. Additionally when and if your site is
	added to <br>
	the database all version checks will originate
	from&nbsp;http://ping.ameoto.com/~v1&nbsp;or
	https://ping.ameoto.com/~v2</p>
	</li>
</ul>
<h2>3. WC Class API</h2>
<p>WhiteCrane can be extended and used as an extension in many
different ways. One example would be to leverage the parser and
exception handling classes <br>
to create a simple commenting script. The use of SPL's autoload feature
means even if you build a very large application around WC and only the
libs that <br>
are instantiated will be loaded thus avoiding IO-bound issues and
unnecessary code maintenance.</p>
<p>WhiteCrane now provides a method for &quot;hooking&quot; custom
code into parts of the application. This is done by creating a callback
while still maintaining access <br>
to class native functions and variables. Below is the loader code used
to run user code as part of the main stack.</p>
<pre>interface WCAPI {
	public function _init();
}
class WC {
	protected static $_callbackArray = array('WCParser' =&gt; false);
    
	public function _api(WCAPI $callback, $type = &quot;_init&quot;){
		$callback-&gt;$type();
	}
	protected function _addCall($gateway, $usrClass, $method){
    	self::$_callbackArray[$gateway][] = array($usrClass, $method);
	}
}</pre>
<p>_api provides a way of initiating a class object in a way that
allows it to run natively as part of the parent in the __contruct
method. If needed create a <br>
callback to your class using _addCall, the first parma selects which
array to store the callback in, currently this is limited to class types
however other <br>
gateways will become available soon. The second parma is the name of the
class you are calling from, to use the same class used to initiate the <br>
callback simply use get_class(void). Finally the last parma is the name
of the method you wish to call. It is called via an instance and
therefor must not be<br>
static( &lt;=5.2 ).</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> While you are able to inherit all of the
extends properties and current public variable values, any changes you
make to them will not be kept after <br>
exiting the callback unless you use __destruct to push the changes back
to the parent.</p>
<p>An example can be found in the plugins folder that interfaces
with the text parser and changes all stances of &quot;WhiteCrane&quot;
to &quot;MaxPayne&quot; via preg_replace.</p>
