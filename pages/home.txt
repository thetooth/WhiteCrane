====Getting Started====
<p>If you can see this message then you have successfully installed WhiteCrane, if your not already logged in you can do so by clicking the + on the bottom right of the page and use the details you entered in the installer. You can also read a quick guide for the {{syntax|syntax here}}.</p>
<p>This cms is little deferent yes? having trouble getting started? Well don't worry because unlike a normal cms with a big complex control panel to manage your files or slow database calls, here everything has been made context sensitive so you don't have to be! </p>
<p><strong>Ok so i want to create a new page but i don't see any button for that?</strong></p>
<p>WhiteCrane works a lot like a Wiki so to create a page you must be on a page that doesn't exist! <br />Sounds weird yes? let me explain, all you need to do is make a link to the page you want to create or you can simply change it in the address bar e.g. ?page=my-new-page, once your on the page you want just use the Create option in the tool bar.</p>
